## **LIBFT**

Libft is the first project we undertake at **Hive** Helsinki, which is a school in the 42 network. It is fundamental to the rest of our studies as we create our own C library with valuable functions that we make use of throughout the duration of the C curriculum. 

As we are not permited to use most built-in C functions we need to handle string manipulation, memory management, character handling, linked list operations and so much more.

My libft has all the required functions from the project, plus a few more that I've added as I've needed them. So this is not an entirely faithful representation of the original project aims.

### **Description**

#### **part 1**

The functions in the first part of the project are copies of standard C ibrary functions and are mostly for string manipulation.

#### **part 2**

In part 2, we look at more string manipulation. But this time, we use malloc and write. These functions are mostly not found in the standard C library.

#### **bonus**

In this part we were introduced to linked lists and linked list manipulation.
